# Civilization 6 Random Drafter (fork from HellBlazer's Civ 5 drafter)

I wanted to re-write HellBlazer's Civ 5 drafter for Civ 6 because the one from Fruitystrike somehow disappeared. Turned out more arduous than I thought, however I found the URL for
http://civdrafter.com/
here:
https://github.com/hosj-IO/civ5rnddrafter

Cheers.
